Solution for question in Quora Hackathon 2014
 The Quora hackathon was held on 6th Dec, 2014. The question can be found at [HackerRank] (https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/quora-haqathon/challenges). I solved quite a few of the problems and prepared the solution which can be found here. I was not able to solve Wombats at all and have partial solution for Ontology as i got only 75/100 point because my DS was not optimal. Feel free to ask questions.
